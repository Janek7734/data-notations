# Lightning McQueen

The story takes place one year after the original movie (likely 2007). Lightning McQueen is dreaming of a street race in Radiator Springs while sleeping in the Cozy Cone Motel.

When Lightning returns to Radiator Springs, Fillmore provides him with a new organic fuel, which gives Lightning the ability to boost.

With the rivalry between McQueen and Hicks growing stronger, McQueen competes in more races with his friends, including a drive up to the Wheel Well Motel in Tailfin Pass with Sally.
